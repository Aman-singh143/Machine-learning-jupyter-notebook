## Project Overview

The **Loan Approval Prediction** project is dedicated to forecasting whether a loan application will be accepted or declined by a financial institution. This prediction relies on an analysis of diverse applicant-related factors, encompassing loan amount, tenure, CIBIL score, education, assets, and more. The primary goal is to uncover the key determinants of loan approval and develop a predictive model capable of estimating the likelihood of loan approval for new applicants. Additionally, the project aims to enhance customer service by prioritizing applications with a higher likelihood of approval.
